# Knight-Tour-Problem-Tree-Search-Framework
This repository implements a tree framework for solving the Knight's Tour Problem using tree search framework with various algorithms (BFS, DFS, DFS-H1B, DFS-H2) and their heuristics. The Knight's Tour problem is a classic combinatorial puzzle where a knight on a chessboard must visit every square exactly once.
