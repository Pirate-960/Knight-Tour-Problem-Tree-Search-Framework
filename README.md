# Knight-Tour-Problem-Tree-Search-Framework  

This repository presents an advanced and extensible framework for solving the **Knight's Tour Problem**, a classic combinatorial puzzle. The framework leverages tree-based search algorithms enhanced with heuristic strategies to tackle the computational challenges associated with this problem.  

## Problem Overview  

The **Knight's Tour Problem** is a chessboard puzzle where a knight must visit every square exactly once. The problem scales in complexity as the board size (\(N\)) increases, with the search space expanding exponentially. For example, while a 5x5 board has 304 possible solutions, the number explodes to over \(10^{35}\) for an 8x8 board. The computational complexity of this problem makes it a rich subject for studying graph traversal, optimization, and search strategies.  

The Knight's Tour problem has historical significance, first appearing in Arabic manuscripts in 840 AD. It later caught the attention of European mathematicians, including Euler, and continues to be a fascinating testbed for modern algorithmic techniques.  

### Problem Variants  

Several classifications and extensions exist for the Knight's Tour Problem:  
- **Open Tour:** The tour does not need to return to the starting square.  
- **Closed or Reentrant Tour:** The knight returns to the starting square, forming a cycle.  
- **Symmetric Tour:** Aesthetic tours that exhibit symmetry properties.  
- **Any Solution:** For large boards, finding just one complete tour is often the primary goal due to the sheer size of the solution space.  

## Features  

### 1. **Search Algorithms Implemented**  

This framework incorporates a variety of search algorithms, providing insights into different problem-solving approaches:  

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**  
  Explores all possible moves level by level. BFS guarantees finding the shortest solution but becomes infeasible for large boards due to high memory usage.  

- **Depth-First Search (DFS):**  
  Explores one path deeply before backtracking. While DFS can find solutions efficiently on smaller boards, it often suffers from dead ends and redundant searches on larger boards.  

- **DFS with Warnsdorff's Heuristic (DFS-H1B):**  
  Implements Warnsdorff's rule to prioritize squares with fewer onward moves, reducing the likelihood of dead ends.  

- **DFS with Enhanced Heuristic (DFS-H2):**  
  Extends Warnsdorff’s method by resolving tie cases using proximity to corners, significantly improving success rates on large boards.  

### 2. **Heuristics for Optimization**  

The repository includes two advanced heuristics to optimize search performance:  

- **Warnsdorff’s Rule (H1B):**  
  - Prefers squares with fewer onward moves, indirectly avoiding dead ends and inaccessible squares.  
  - Efficient for moderate board sizes but fails in specific configurations or very large boards (\(N > 300\)).  

- **Enhanced Heuristic (H2):**  
  - Builds on H1B by prioritizing squares closer to the corners in tie cases.  
  - Provides complete tours on large boards in \(O(N^2)\) time without backtracking.  
  - Successfully addresses cases where H1B fails, making it robust for practical applications.  

The heuristic functions demonstrate how intelligent decision-making can dramatically reduce the search space, transforming intractable problems into solvable ones.  

### 3. **Tree Framework**  

At the core of the implementation lies a tree-based representation of the problem:  
- Nodes represent the knight's current position.  
- Edges correspond to valid knight moves.  
- The search tree is dynamically constructed to explore possible tours.  
- The framework supports modular integration of new algorithms or heuristics.  

This structure facilitates a systematic exploration of solutions and enables efficient pruning of non-viable paths.  

### 4. **Historical and Mathematical Context**  

- **Early Records:** The first recorded Knight’s Tours were found in Arabic manuscripts around 840 AD.  
- **Mathematical Exploration:** Euler analyzed the problem in the 18th century, paving the way for studies in graph theory and combinatorial optimization.  
- **Modern Algorithms:** Advances in computational power have enabled exhaustive enumeration and heuristic-driven exploration for larger boards.  

### 5. **Comparative Analysis of Algorithms**  

The repository includes tools to compare the performance of various search strategies:  
- **Execution Time:** Benchmarks show the efficiency of heuristic-guided methods compared to brute force.  
- **Solution Quality:** H2 consistently outperforms H1B on challenging boards, ensuring fewer dead ends and faster convergence.  
- **Scalability:** The framework demonstrates the limitations of uninformed search and highlights the scalability of heuristic methods for large boards.  

### 6. **Applications and Implications**  

Beyond its recreational appeal, the Knight’s Tour Problem has applications in:  
- **Robotics:** Path planning for mobile robots navigating constrained spaces.  
- **Algorithm Design:** Benchmarking new search and optimization techniques.  
- **Educational Tools:** Teaching graph traversal, heuristics, and combinatorial problem-solving.
